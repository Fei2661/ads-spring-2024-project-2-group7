+ **Project summary**: Through an extensive analysis spanning multiple datasets, our investigation focus on several key aspects of disaster relief and insurance decisions, leveraging the power of data visualization within a Shiny app environment. This exploration was guided by questions concerning the relationship between income and insurance purchase decisions, the dynamics of disaster relief across different subsidies, and the distribution and approval rates of FEMA assistance across various counties and between renters and owners.
